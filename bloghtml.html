<div id="c12title"><h4><center>"The artificial sun", another invention giving you a deep idea of the advancement of science. The fuel to this device, is continuously provided by the ocean, inexhaustibly. This device has achieved a tremendous amount of 100 million degree Celsius, and is able to heat upto 10MW, which makes this device capable enough to replace the indigenous Sun.

The basic principal of this, the Nuclear fusion is possible only if the central temperature reaches 100 Million degree Celsius , and this is 6 times hotter than the core of a burning star.
The Institute of Plasma Physics, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced on its website that various data points achieved in the experiments met the demand for future steady-state fusion reactor operation, and this device is also providing the cleanest form of nuclear enery. The nuclear sun , along with EAST was built to harness the energy or fusion.

The EAST was designed and built by China in 2006 in Hefei which is in the Anhui province of east China. And this is called, "The Artificial sun" , as this just like The Sun, uses deuterium and tritium, which are abundantly available in the ocean to produce Nuclear fusion. This equipment is 11 meters tall, with a diameter of 8 meters, and a weight of 400 tons.

After setting a world record by achieving 101.2 seconds of steady-state H-mode operation of EAST in 2017, scientists started their research on physical mechanism of the core under high power heating in 2018, said the institute.

Achievements realized in 2018 in EAST experiments will provide important and direct experience for the construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). EAST, in comparison with ITER is smaller, still similar and more flexible.
During the building period of ITER, EAST will be one of the very few international devices, for conducting ITER related steady-state advanced plasma science and technology research, according to the institute.</center></h4></div>
